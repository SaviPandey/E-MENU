In todayâ€™s digital world hiring people to just take orders from customers has become too expensive because of the salaries of the employees which adds on to the cost of cutlery and many other expenses of a restaurant. This is where the concept of e-Menu comes into the picture. This provides a fast and efficient solution to all the problems faced by the restaurants. Firstly, it allows the customer to order without waiting for anyone to come to them. This makes the customer happy and calm. Secondly, it helps the restaurant to cut on the cost for printing and designing the menu in a fancy way, except the cost incurred to make the e-Menu. Thirdly, it allows the customer to see the previously ordered items so that they can have what they want

We have implemented this using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and PHP for designing the webpages and connection to database. MySQL has been used to store the orders and login details of the customer. Finally, we have used AWS EC2 to host the dynamic website. The QR code is generated using the website QR code generator.
